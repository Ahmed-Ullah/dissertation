
How to use this template:
1)	The dissertation_song.tex file is the main file, which allows you to enter your thesis body chapter by chaper.
2)	For each chapter, you can name it to be an individual .tex file.
3)	This template includes examples of inserting figures, references (strongly recommend Jabref for generating reference list), and the use of nomenclature:
Ps: If you are using winedt instead of Kile or other compiler, in order to have nomenclature work, you will need to type in 'makeindex test123.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o test123.nls' into the command window(change test 123 to the name of your main file)
4)	You only need to compile the main tex file to generate your thesis.

I found this class file originally written Paul Kilgo, and modified it according to the requirements of the graduate school. Hope it can save you some time during writing! 
Good luck! Yuanyuan Song
