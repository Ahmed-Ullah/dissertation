%%%%%linear stability analysis conclusion%%%%%
In this thesis, we investigated the instability of a bilayer coating a compliant tube with an insoluble surfactant monolayer along the \textit{mucus-gas} interface. The instability in this model is primarily caused by high surface tension, which drives a capillary flow into a growing bulge, and wall compliance. Surfactants can have a significant impact on this instability by modifying the surface tension (the parameter $s$) and the tangential stress along the \textit{mucus-gas} interface (the Marangoni number). We also examined the effects of the following parameters: the bilayer thickness parameter $\eps$; the wall compliance parameter $\Gamma$; the wall damping parameter $\phi$; the viscosity ratio $\gamma$; and the aspect ratio $\lambda$.

A system of nonlinear evolution equations for the interfaces, the wall deformation and the surfactant concentration was derived using an extended lubrication theory model. Although this is not a fully rational model, it has certain features that make it more accurate than the classical lubrication theory approach used for example by Hammond\cite{Hammond1983}. First, the full curvature terms are used without doing a Taylor series about $\eps=0$ which is what is done in the classical model. Second, the radial coordinate $r^\ast$ is not replaced by $a$. Thus, local coordinate which essentially planarizes the bilayer. These equations were then linearized and a normal mode analysis was carried out to investigate how fast initial disturbances grew.

In the limit as $\eps\rightarrow 0$ we showed that the linear stability results obtained from the extended lubrication theory model matched with those obtained from the classical lubrication models that are described in detail in Appendices \ref{appa_appendix} and \ref{appb_appendix}. We also derived an eigenvalue problem valid for all wavenumbers and film thicknesses, but we assumed the wall to be rigid. We used this model to validate our extended lubrication theory model, and showed that the latter gave accurate solutions for the growth rate even when $\eps$ was not so small and that the accuracy improved with increasing $\Ma$. Numerical results showed that the maximum growth rate increased with increasing $\eps$, $s$, $\lambda$, or $\Gamma$ but decreased with increasing $\Ma$, $\phi$, or $\gamma$.

We also solved the nonlinear evolution equations numerically using a method of lines beyond the linear regime. The influence of wall compliance, wall damping, surfactant strength and bilayer thickness were studied. Numerical results showed that the wall damping parameter $\phi$ had significant effect on the system when the wall was relatively flexible, but had not noticeable impact when the wall was quite stiff. Airway closure happened faster with higher wall compliance or less surfactant along the liquid-gas interface. As in the single layer model, increasing the bilayer thickness sped up the formation of a liquid bridge.
%In this thesis, we investigated the instability of a bilayer coating a compliant tube with insoluble surfactant monolayer spreading along the \textit{mucus-gas} interface as introduced in chapter \ref{chap: Governing_Eqn_boundary_conditions_dim}. The instability in this model was caused by high surface-tension at the interfaces of \textit{serous-mucus} and the \textit{mucus-gas} interface. Various parameters were introduced due to the different physical characteristics of the two liquid layers: the unperturbed surface tension ratio $s$, the viscosity ratio $\Gamma$, the thickness of the bilayer $\eps$, and the aspect ratio $\lambda$. We also had Marangoni number used to measure the surfactant concentration, and the wall parameters, such as the wall compliance parameter $\Gamma$, the initial circumferential tension of the tube wall to the surface tension $T_0$, the longitudinal wall tension to surface tension $T_{\ell}$, the wall damping parameter $\phi$. Changing systematic parameters would result in instability of this model. An extended lubrication theory model was used in order to provide more information of the bilayer thickness by retaining the unperturbed interfacial locations. By taking limiting values of certain parameters, a bilayer coating a rigid tube with surfactant and a bilayer contained within a flexible tube with clean surfaces, even single layer models could be recovered. For instance, taking $\lambda=0$ or $1$ results in single layer models, setting $\Ma=0$ gives clean surface at the \textit{mucus-gas} interface, letting wall compliance parameter $\Gamma=0$ one can get rigid tube models.
%A classical lubrication theory was applied to simpler models: a bilayer coated within a rigid tube with surfactant and a bilayer contained within a compliant tube with clean interfaces. Results obtained by this approach served as validation together with the arbitrary thickness approach results. Based on the method used in Goren's \cite{Goren1962} paper, we introduced two stream functions into the bilayer, and therefore derived an eigenvalue problem involving modified Bessel functions. Comparisons were made among three approaches for different various parameters by plotting the maximum growth rate of the perturbations $\xi_{max}$ versus different parameters, such as changing the bilayer thickness, the viscosity ratio, surface tension ratio, and etc. Numerical results showed that the growth rate $\xi\uparrow$ as $\eps\uparrow$; $\xi\uparrow$ with $s$; and $\xi\downarrow$ as increasing the surfactant concentration $\Ma$; $\xi\uparrow$ if $\lambda\uparrow$, we fixed all other parameters while changing the parameter that we investigated. Base set parameter values were chosen from the dimensional data of the lung and some experiments, and variation of each parameter was selected based propertied changes of liquid bilayer possibly caused by lung diseases. Comparisons showed that the extended lubrication theory provides more accurate results than the ones obtained by the classical lubrication theory for the rigid tube models, while avoid computation involving modified Bessel functions as in the arbitrary thickness approach. By taking $\eps\rightarrow$, all three approaches agreed. The extended lubrication theory also works pretty well even for relatively large $\eps$ for fixed set of parameter values. Therefore, we have confidence to investigate the more general case, a bilayer coating compliant tube with insoluble surfactant along the liquid-gas interface, by using this extended lubrication theory model.
%The influence of the wall compliance and damping, the surfactant concentration $\Ma$, the bilayer parameters, and interactions among those factors was investigated. $\xi\uparrow$ as $\Gamma\uparrow$, $\lambda\uparrow$, $s\uparrow$; $\xi\downarrow$ with increasing $\Ma$, $\phi$, or $\gamma$. When the surfactant was saturated, $\xi$ leveled off with even larger $\Ma$. We also studied the wavenumber of perturbations and discovered a so called critical wavenumber $k_c$, where infinite $\xi$ occurs at a finite wavenumber, which had a more complicated expression and depended on more parameters. By increasing wall damping parameter $\phi$, such singular behavior could be dampened even for relatively large wall compliance. One could re-obtain $k_c$ for the single layer model as in Halpern \& Grotberg \cite{HALPERN1992} by taking limiting values of certain parameters.
%%%%%%Nonlinear stability analysis conclusion%%%%
%Nonlinear stability analysis was carried out based on the nonlinear evolution equations derived by using the extended lubrication theory. Method of lines was adopted with fourth order accuracy in spatial direction.

%%%%%Future work%%%%%%%
We neglected certain effects which could be investigated in the future. For example, the core flow in the airways of the lung is time dependent and could be significant in high frequency ventilation by imposing a stress on the bilayer. One would then have to take into account a base flow in the bilayer, which would result in a order analysis of the perturbation amplitudes in the derivation of the evolution equations. We modeled the mucus as a Newtonian fluid. Actually, mucus behaves like a non-Newtonian viscoelastic fluid. Thus in the future a more realistic rheological model should be considered. Also, inertia becomes increasingly important and may need to be included in order to accurately describe plug formation. This bilayer model could also be of importance in the oil recovery process where the injection of surfactants into an oil well can lead to enhanced oil recovery.
%In the future, more investigations can be conducted for this bilayer model. For instance, one may consider to take the base flow in the liquid bilayer into account, which would result in a order analysis of the perturbation amplitudes in the derivation of the evolution equations. The possible engineering application is oil recovery. By injecting surfactants into the oil well, the oil recovery can be enhanced. Inertia effects of the bilayer can also be studied in the stability analysis. The bilayer model can be more practical provided the mucus layer to be Newtonian.
