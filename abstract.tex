The Poisson Boltzmann equation (PBE) is a well-established implicit solvent continuum model for the electrostatic analysis of solvated biomolecules. The solution for the nonlinear PBE is still a challenge due to its strong singularity by the source terms, dielectrically distinct regions, and exponential nonlinear terms. In this paper, a new alternating direction implicit method (ADI) is proposed for solving the nonlinear PBE using a two-component regularization. This scheme inherits all the advantages of the two-component regularization and the time-dependent PBE with ADI method while possess a novel approach to combine them. A modified version of the one-dimensional ghost fluid method (GFM) has been introduced to incorporate the nonzero jump condition into a new ADI method. The proposed scheme produced better accuracy compared to the previous ADI methods for a benchmark problem and simpler to implement by circumventing the work necessary to apply the MIB method with the regularization for a 3D problem. Though this scheme can use larger time increments than the previous ADI method, it still blows up for large time increments. Later to address this issue with the stability, Locally One Dimensional (LOD) method has been used to replace the ADI method as the operator splitting part. Finally, to test the ability of this newly proposed ADI-GFM and LOD-GFM method, we have evaluated the solvation free energy for a collection of 24 proteins with various sizes and the salt effect on protein-protein binding energy of the complex 1beb.
