	Abstract = {SUMMARY This paper presents an improved mathematical model for biomolecular surface representation and solvation analysis. Based on the Eulerian formulation, the polar and nonpolar contributions to the solvation process can be equally accounted for via a unified free energy functional. Using the variational analysis, two nonlinear partial differential equations, that is, one Poisson--Boltzmann (PB) type equation for electrostatic potential and one geometric flow type equation defining the solute--solvent interface, can be derived. To achieve a more efficient and stable coupling, we propose a time-dependent PB equation by introducing a pseudo-time. The system of nonlinear partial differential equations can then be coupled via the standard time integration. Furthermore, the numerical treatment of nonlinear terms becomes easier in the present model. Based on a hypersurface function, the biomolecular surface is represented as a smooth interface. However, for the nonlinear PB equation, such a smooth interface may cause unphysical blowup because of the existence of nonvanishing values within the solute domain. A filtering process is proposed to circumvent this problem. Example solvation analysis of various compounds and proteins was carried out to validate the proposed model. The contributions of electrostatic interactions to the protein--protein binding affinity are studied for selected protein complexes.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present an efficient and accurate numerical algorithm for calculating the electrostatic interactions in biomolecular systems. In our scheme, a boundary integral equation (BIE) approach is applied to discretize the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation. The resulting integral formulas are well conditioned for single molecule cases as well as for systems with more than one macromolecule, and are solved efficiently using Krylov subspace based iterative methods such as generalized minimal residual (GMRES) or biconjugate gradient stabilized (BiCGStab) methods. In each iteration, the convolution type matrix-vector multiplications are accelerated by a new version of the fast multipole method (FMM). The implemented algorithm is asymptotically optimal O(N) both in CPU time and memory usage with optimized prefactors. Our approach enhances the present computational ability to treat electrostatics of large scale systems in protein-protein interactions and nano particle assembly processes. Applications including calculating the electrostatics of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and interactions between protein Sso7d and DNA are presented.

@article{Juffer1991,
	Abstract = {A general numerical method is presented to compute the electric potential for a macromolecule of arbitrary shape in a solvent with nonzero ionic strength. The model is based on a continuum description of the dielectric and screening properties of the system, which consists of a bounded internal region with discrete charges and an infinite external region. The potential obeys the Poisson equation in the internal region and the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation in the external region, coupled through appropriate boundary conditions. It is shown how this three-dimensional problem can be presented as a pair of coupled integral equations for the potential and the normal component of the electric field at the dielectric interface. These equations can be solved by a straightforward application of boundary element techniques. The solution involves the decomposition of a matrix that depends only on the geometry of the surface and not on the positions of the charges. With this approach the number of unknowns is reduced by an order of magnitude with respect to the usual finite difference methods. Special attention is given to the numerical inaccuracies resulting from charges which are located close to the interface; an adapted formulation is given for that case. The method is tested both for a spherical geometry, for which an exact solution is available, and for a realistic problem, for which a finite difference solution and experimental verification is available. The latter concerns the shift in acid strength (pK-values) of histidines in the copper-containing protein azurin on oxidation of the copper, for various values of the ionic strength. A general method is given to triangulate a macromolecular surface. The possibility is discussed to use the method presented here for a correct treatment of long-range electrostatic interactions in simulations of solvated macromolecules, which form an essential part of correct potentials of mean force. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

The solvation forces are obtained from the formal solution of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation written in terms of the Green function. An intermediate region for the solute-solvent dielectric boundary is introduced to yield a continuous solvation free energy and accurate solvation forces. A series of numerical tests show that the calculated forces agree extremely well with finite- difference derivatives of the solvation free energy. To gain a maximum efficiency, the nonpolar contribution to the free energy is expressed in terms of the discretized grid used for the electrostatic problem.

The electrostatic free energy is calculated by decomposing the various energy terms into Coulombic interactions so that that the calculated free energies are independent of the lattice used to solve the PB equation. This, together with algorithms that optimally position polarization charges on the molecular surface, leads to a significant decrease in the dependence of the electrostatic free energy on the resolution of the lattice used to solve the PB equation and, hence, to a remarkable improvement in the precision of the calculated values.

A detailed analysis of the resulting method is presented, with comparisons to other methods that have been proposed in the literature, including the classical nonlinear multigrid method, the nonlinear conjugate gradient method, and nonlinear relaxation methods such as successive over-relaxation. Both theoretical and numerical evidence suggests that this method will converge in the case of molecules for which many of the existing methods will not. In addition, for problems which the other methods are able to solve, numerical experiments show that the new method is substantially more efficient, and the superiority of this method grows with the problem size. The method is easy to implement once a linear multilevel solver is available, and can also easily be used in conjunction with linear methods other than multigrid},

	Abstract = {The nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation is solved using Newton-Krylov iterations coupled with pseudo-transient continuation. The PB potential is used to compute the electrostatic energy and evaluate the force on a user-specified contour. The PB solver is embedded in a existing, 3D, massively parallel, unstructured-grid, finite element code. Either Dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions are allowed. The latter specifies surface charges, approximates far-field conditions, or linearizes conditions "regulating" the surface charge. Stability and robustness are proved using results for backward Euler differencing of diffusion equations. Potentials and energies of charged spheres and plates are computed and results compared to analysis. An approximation to the potential of the nonlinear, spherical charge is derived by combining two analytic formul{\ae}. The potential and force due to a conical probe interacting with a flat plate are computed for two types of boundary conditions: constant potential and constant charge. The second case is compared with direct force measurements by chemical force microscopy. The problem is highly nonlinear - surface potentials of the linear and nonlinear PB equations differ by over an order of magnitude. Comparison of the simulated and experimentally measured forces shows that approximately half of the surface carboxylic acid groups, of density 1/(0.2 nm2), ionize in the electrolyte implying surface charges of 0.4 C/m2, surface potentials of 0.27 V, and a force of 0.6 nN when the probe and plate are 8.7 nm apart. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

@article{Cai2009,
	Abstract = {The Poisson-Boltzmann theory has become widely accepted in modeling electrostatic solvation interactions in biomolecular calculations. However the standard practice of atomic point charges in molecular mechanics force fields introduces singularity into the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The finite-difference/finite-volume discretization approach to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation alleviates the numerical difficulty associated with the charge singularity but introduces discretization error into the electrostatic potential. Decomposition of the electrostatic potential has been explored to remove the charge singularity explicitly to achieve higher numerical accuracy in the solution of the electrostatic potential. In this study, we propose an efficient method to overcome the charge singularity problem. In our framework, two separate equations for two different potentials in two different regions are solved simultaneously, i.e., the reaction field potential in the solute region and the total potential in the solvent region. The proposed method can be readily implemented with typical finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann solvers and return the singularity-free reaction field potential with a single run. Test runs on 42 small molecules and 4 large proteins show a very high agreement between the reaction field energies computed by the proposed method and those by the classical finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann method. It is also interesting to note that the proposed method converges faster than the classical method, though additional time is needed to compute Coulombic potential on the dielectric boundary. The higher precision, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method will allow for more robust electrostatic calculations in molecular mechanics simulations of complex biomolecular systems.},

	Abstract = {We develop an efficient and reliable adaptive finite element method (AFEM) for the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE). We first examine the regularization technique of Chen, Holst, and Xu; this technique made possible the first a priori pointwise estimates and the first complete solution and approximation theory for the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. It also made possible the first provably convergent discretization of the PBE, and allowed for the development of a provably convergent AFEM for the PBE. However, in practice the regularization turns out to be numerically ill-conditioned. In this article, we examine a second regularization, and establish a number of basic results to ensure that the new approach produces the same mathematical advantages of the original regularization, without the ill-conditioning property. We then design an AFEM scheme based on the new regularized problem, and show that the resulting AFEM scheme is accurate and reliable, by proving a contraction result for the error. This result, which is one of the first results of this type for nonlinear elliptic problems, is based on using continuous and discrete a priori pointwise estimates to establish quasi-orthogonality. To provide a high-quality geometric model as input to the AFEM algorithm, we also describe a class of feature-preserving adaptive mesh generation algorithms designed specifically for constructing meshes of biomolecular structures, based on the intrinsic local structure tensor of the molecular surface. The stability advantages of the new regularization are demonstrated using an FETK-based implementation, through comparisons with the original regularization approach for a model problem. The convergence and accuracy of the overall AFEM algorithm is also illustrated by numerical approximation of electrostatic solvation energy for an insulin protein.},

	Abstract = {This work introduces novel operator splitting alternating direction implicit (ADI) schemes to overcome numerical difficulties in solving pseudo-time coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) for biomolecular solvation analysis. Based on the variational formulation, a pseudo-transient continuation model has been previously formulated to couple a nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann (NPB) equation for the electrostatic potential with a generalized Laplace--Beltrami equation defining the biomolecular surface. However, the standard numerical integration of the time dependent NPB equation is known to be very inefficient. Moreover, it encounters instability issues for smoothly varying solute--solvent interfaces so that a filtering process has to be conducted. In the present work, we propose to solve the unsteady NPB equation in an operator splitting framework so that the nonlinear instability can be completely avoided through an analytical integration. Central finite differences are employed to discretize the nonhomogeneous diffusion term of the generalized NPB equation to form tridiagonal matrices in the Douglas and Douglas--Rachford type ADI schemes. The proposed time splitting ADI schemes are found to be unconditionally stable for solving the NPB equation in benchmark examples with analytical solutions. For the solvation analysis involving two pseudo-time coupled nonlinear PDEs, the time stability of the NPB equation can be maintained by using very large time increments, so that without sacrificing the accuracy, the present biomolecular simulation becomes over ten times faster.},

	Abstract = {The Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model is an e ective approach for the electrostatics analysis of solvated biomolecules. The nonlinearity associated with the PB equation is critical when the underlying electrostatic potential is strong, but is extremely di cult to solve numerically. In this paper, we construct two operator splitting alternating direction implicit (ADI) schemes to e ciently and stably solve the nonlinear PB equation in a pseudo-transient continuation approach. The operator splitting framework enables an analytical integration of the nonlinear term that suppresses the nonlinear instability. A standard finite di erence scheme weighted by piecewise dielectric constants varying across the molecular surface is employed to discretize the nonhomogeneous di usion term of the nonlinear PB equation, and yields tridiagonal matrices in the Douglas and Douglas-Rachford type ADI schemes. The proposed time splitting ADI schemes are di erent from all existing pseudo-transient continuation approaches for solving the classical nonlinear PB equation in the sense that they are fully implicit. In a numerical benchmark example, the steady state solutions of the fully-implicit ADI schemes based on different initial values all converge to the time invariant analytical solution, while those of the explicit Euler and semi-implicit ADI schemes blow up when the magnitude of the initial solution is large.

	Abstract = {Interfaces have a variety of boundary conditions (or jump conditions) that need to be enforced. The Ghost Fluid Method (GFM) was developed to capture the boundary conditions at a contact discontinuity in the inviscid Euler equations and has been extended to treat more general discontinuities such as shocks, detonations, and deflagrations and compressible viscous flows. In this paper, a similar boundary condition capturing approach is used to develop a new numerical method for the variable coefficient Poisson equation in the presence of interfaces where both the variable coefficients and the solution itself may be discontinuous. This new method is robust and easy to implement even in three spatial dimensions. Furthermore, the coefficient matrix of the associated linear system is the standard symmetric matrix for the variable coefficient Poisson equation in the absence of interfaces allowing for straightforward application of standard ``black box'' solvers.},

In contrast, Lagrangian schemes work well at multimaterial interfaces, but suffer from their own difficulties in problems with large deformations and vorticity characteristic of most gas flows. We believe that the most robust schemes will combine the best properties of Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes. In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for treating interfaces in Eulerian schemes that maintains a Heaviside profile of the density with no numerical smearing along the lines of earlier work and most Lagrangian schemes. We use a level set function to track the motion of a multimaterial interface in an Eulerian framework. In addition, the use of ghost cells (actually ghost nodes in our finite difference framework) and a new isobaric fix technique allows us to keep the density profile from smearing out, while still keeping the scheme robust and easy to program with simple extensions to multidimensions and multilevel time integration, e.g., Runge--Kutta methods. In contrast, previous methods used ill-advised dimensional splitting for multidimensional problems and suffered from great complexity when used in conjunction with multilevel time integrators.},

The method employs a well-conditioned boundary integral formulation for the electrostatic potential and its normal derivative on the molecular surface. The surface is triangulated and the integral equations are discretized by centroid collocation. The linear system is solved by GMRES iteration and the matrix-vector product is carried out by a Cartesian tree code which reduces the cost from O(N2) to O(NlogN), where N is the number of faces in the triangulation. The TABI solver is applied to compute the electrostatic solvation energy in two cases, the Kirkwood sphere and a solvated protein. We present the error, CPU time, and memory usage, and compare results for the Poisson-Boltzmann and Poisson equations. We show that the treecode approximation error can be made smaller than the discretization error, and we compare two versions of the treecode, one with uniform clusters and one with non-uniform clusters adapted to the molecular surface. For the protein test case, we compare TABI results with those obtained using the grid-based APBS code, and we also present parallel TABI simulations using up to eight processors. We find that the TABI solver exhibits good serial and parallel performance combined with relatively simple implementation, efficient memory usage, and geometric adaptability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {AbstractThe Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model is an effective approach for the electrostatics analysis of solvated biomolecules. The nonlinearity associated with the PB equation is critical when the underlying electrostatic potential is strong, but is extremely difficult to solve numerically. In this paper, we construct two operator splitting alternating direction implicit (ADI) schemes to efficiently and stably solve the nonlinear PB equation in a pseudo-transient continuation approach. The operator splitting framework enables an analytical integration of the nonlinear term that suppresses the nonlinear instability. A standard finite difference scheme weighted by piecewise dielectric constants varying across the molecular surface is employed to discretize the nonhomogeneous diffusion term of the nonlinear PB equation, and yields tridiagonal matrices in the Douglas and Douglas-Rachford type ADI schemes. The proposed time splitting ADI schemes are different from all existing pseudo-transient continuation approaches for solving the classical nonlinear PB equation in the sense that they are fully implicit. In a numerical benchmark example, the steady state solutions of the fully-implicit ADI schemes based on different initial values all converge to the time invariant analytical solution, while those of the explicit Euler and semi-implicit ADI schemes blow up when the magnitude of the initial solution is large. For the solvation analysis in applications to real biomolecules with various sizes, the time stability of the proposed ADI schemes can be maintained even using very large time increments, demonstrating the efficiency and stability of the present methods for biomolecular simulation. },

In time discretization, this new ADI method is found to be of first order and stable in various experiments. In space discretization, the matched ADI method achieves the second order accuracy based on simple Cartesian grids for various irregularly-shaped surfaces and spatial-temporal dependent jumps. Computationally, the matched ADI method is as efficient as the fastest implicit scheme based on the geometrical multigrid for solving 3D parabolic equations, in the sense that its complexity in each time step scales linearly with respect to the spatial degree of freedom N, i.e., O(N). Furthermore, unlike iterative methods, the ADI method is an exact or non-iterative algebraic solver which guarantees to stop after a certain number of computations for a fixed N. Therefore, the proposed matched ADI method provides a very promising tool for solving 3D parabolic interface problems.},

	Abstract = {A novel Douglas alternating direction implicit (ADI) method is proposed in this work to solve a two-dimensional (2D) heat equation with interfaces. The ADI scheme is a powerful finite difference method for solving parabolic equations, due to its unconditional stability and high efficiency. However, it suffers from a serious accuracy reduction in space for interface problems with different materials and nonsmooth solutions. If the jumps in a function and its derivatives are known across the interface, rigorous ADI schemes have been successfully constructed in the literature based on the immersed interface method (IIM) so that the spatial accuracy can be restored. Nevertheless, the development of accurate and stable ADI methods for general parabolic interface problems with physical interface conditions that describe jumps of a function and its flux, remains unsolved. To overcome this difficulty, a novel tensor product decomposition is proposed in this paper to decouple 2D jump conditions into essentially one-dimensional (1D) ones. These 1D conditions can then be incorporated into the ADI central difference discretization, using the matched interface and boundary (MIB) technique. Fast algebraic solvers for perturbed tridiagonal systems are developed to maintain the computational efficiency. Stability analysis is conducted through eigenvalue spectrum analysis, which numerically demonstrates the unconditional stability of the proposed ADI method. The matched ADI scheme achieves the first order of accuracy in time and second order of accuracy in space in all tested parabolic interface problems with complex geometries and spatial-temporal dependent jump conditions.},

The LSEK can solve the above PDEs with x-indep endent coefficients in a single step.

Its complexity scales as O(N) at a fixed level of accuracy. It is explicit, time transverse invariant, unconditionally stable for many problems whose two split parts are both analytically integrable. It adopts uniform grid meshes. The proposed method is extensively validated in terms of accuracy, stability, efficiency, robustness and reliability by the Fokker-Planck equation, the Black-Scholes equation, the heat equation, the plane wave propagation, the Zakharov system, and a linear harmonic oscillator.

Refinement with PROLSQ yields a model with an R value of 10·5%. The final model had three parameter anisotropic vibration factors for all atoms, which included 367 protein heavy atoms, 372 hydrogen atoms and 144 solvent atoms with one ethanol molecule. Dihedral angles and hydrogen-bonding distances generally agree with earlier studies of high-resolution protein structures, but some new patterns are noted. Solvent-related helix distortions are reminiscent of those described by others. Helix and β-sheet regions show distinct patterns in their side-chain conformations. Despite crambin's hydrophobic nature, its accessible surface area in the crystal is surprisingly close to that of water-soluble proteins like myoglobin and carboxypeptidase A. More of crambin's hydrophobic surface is buried in the crystal, perhaps accounting for its high order of diffraction. A total of 24% of the 46 residues show discrete disorder at 130 K. This includes five side-chains at both 300 and 130 K, and six more side-chains and an ethanol molecule at 130 K. Disorder is associated with the sequence microheterogeneity at Pro/Ser22 and Leu/Ile25, with space filling or with solvent disorder. Correlated conformations extend over three to five residues. The patterns of disorder in this structure reveal important principles of protein structure and its dynamics. Finding disordered groups correlated over 5 to 8 Å suggests that co-ordinated motion extends in groups rather than simply as uncorrelated movement around an atom center. Thermal diffuse scattering experiments on insulin and lysozyme are consistent with this interpretation. Nearly all of the protein-bound solvent has been located. Less than 1% of protein accessible surface area remains uncovered by solvent or crystal contacts. Preliminary analysis of the solvent network reveals two main networks in each of four solvent regions."

PB based molecular dynamics (MD) approach has a potential to tackle large biological systems. Obstacles that hinder the current development of PB based MD methods are concerns in accuracy, stability, efficiency and reliability. The presence of complex solvent--solute interface, geometric singularities and charge singularities leads to challenges in the numerical solution of the PB equation and electrostatic force evaluation in PB based MD methods. Recently, the matched interface and boundary (MIB) method has been utilized to develop the first second order accurate PB solver that is numerically stable in dealing with discontinuous dielectric coefficients, complex geometric singularities and singular source charges. The present work develops the PB based MD approach using the MIB method. New formulation of electrostatic forces is derived to allow the use of sharp molecular surfaces. Accurate reaction field forces are obtained by directly differentiating the electrostatic potential. Dielectric boundary forces are evaluated at the solvent--solute interface using an accurate Cartesian-grid surface integration method. The electrostatic forces located at reentrant surfaces are appropriately assigned to related atoms. Extensive numerical tests are carried out to validate the accuracy and stability of the present electrostatic force calculation. The new PB based MD method is implemented in conjunction with the AMBER package. MIB based MD simulations of biomolecules are demonstrated via a few example systems.},

However, research in this area has so far failed to yield attractive lead compounds because of the insufficient development of RNA-based medicinal chemistry. One difficulty in efforts to inhibit protein-RNA interactions using small druglike molecules is the large surface areas typically found at these interfaces. To overcome this problem, we sought to identify constrained peptidomimetic inhibitors that would provide potential new drug leads. We previously reported the discovery of a cyclic peptide mimic of the RNA-binding domain of BIV Tat protein based on a designed beta-hairpin scaffold. We demonstrated that the cyclic peptide bound BIV TAR RNA with an affinity comparable to that of the RNA-binding domain of the Tat protein and inhibited protein binding to the RNA. In this study, we report the structure of the complex of the cyclic peptide bound to BIV TAR RNA determined using heteronuclear NMR methods. The structure reveals a beta-hairpin conformation in the bound peptide, which adopts an unexpected orientation in the major groove of the RNA opposite those observed for peptides derived from the Tat protein.

	Abstract = {The Poisson--Boltzmann equation (PBE) is one widely-used implicit solvent continuum model in the calculation of electrostatic potential energy for biomolecules in ionic solvent, but its numerical solution remains a challenge due to its strong singularity and nonlinearity caused by its singular distribution source terms and exponential nonlinear terms. To effectively deal with such a challenge, in this paper, new solution decomposition and minimization schemes are proposed, together with a new PBE analysis on solution existence and uniqueness. Moreover, a PBE finite element program package is developed in Python based on the FEniCS program library and GAMer, a molecular surface and volumetric mesh generation program package. Numerical tests on proteins and a nonlinear Born ball model with an analytical solution validate the new solution decomposition and minimization schemes, and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the new PBE finite element program package.},
