%%%Motivation and applications%%%
The stability of a liquid bilayer coating the inner surface of a flexible tube is investigated (in the presence of an insoluble monolayer of surfactant along the \textit{liquid-gas} interface). This problem is inspired by several practical applications. For example, lung disease control and prevention: the airways in the lung are coated with a bilayer consisting of a mucous layer and a serous fluid layer. When airway closure happens, either due to the collapse of the tube wall or the thickening of the liquid bilayer (Engel \etal\cite{engel1975demonstration}), for instance caused by the exposure to smoke (Hulbert \etal \cite{hulbert1982improved}), it may be a signal of lung disease. Also, the occurrence of airway closure may be affected by many factors due to inhomogeneities in the lung of individuals (West \etal\cite{west2012respiratory}). When the single-breath nitrogen washout test, which is also known as a standard pulmonary function test, shows early signs of airway closure, it often indicates that there is an inhomogeneous ventilation distribution (Crawford \etal\cite{crawford1989effect}). Since the detection of the onset of diseases in small airways is difficult, the study of this model might be beneficial for deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in airway closure.

Efficient transportation of crude oil is another application of this model, where thin liquid layers can be used as lubricant layers. In geology, a multilayer-film model has also been used to analyze the transverse ridges generated on the surfaces of rock glacier forms (Kliakhandler \cite{kliakhandler1999long}).

%%%%%Summary of previous work%%%%%%%%%%%
Stability analysis of a thin liquid layer coating a tube/anular has drawn attention from a lot of researchers. The phenomenon of an annular thread of fluid was mathematically described by Rayleigh\cite{Rayleigh1879Capillary} \& \cite{Rayleigh1892xvi}, Weber \cite{weber1931zerfall}, and Tomotika \cite{tomotika1935instability}. Rayleigh \cite{Rayleigh1879} firstly investigated instability of liquid jets, and found that instability occurs if wavelength exceeds the radius of the core fluid. Goren\cite{Goren1962} studied the stability of a viscous liquid film coating a wire or the inner surface of a tube by deriving an eigenvalue problem for the stream function after inserting all interfacial and boundary conditions. He computed the growth rate of the disturbance as a function of the wavenumber, and like Rayleigh, he showed that surface tension is destabilizing at small wavenumbers. This approach is valid for arbitrarily thick liquid layer. Hammond\cite{Hammond1983} and Gauglitz \& Radke \cite{GAUGLITZ1988} investigated the stability of a single layer coating the inner surface of a rigid tube using lubrication theory. Gauglitz and Radke derived a nonlinear evolution equation for the film thickness and found that if $\eps>0.12$, a liquid bridge could form that blocked the tube, where $\eps$ is the film thickness to the tube radius. Halpern and Grotberg \cite{HALPERN1992} extended their models by considering a compliant tube. They also applied lubrication theory to derive a system of nonlinear evolution equations for the film thickness and wall location. They were motivated by the fact that the respiratory bronchioles may close off either due to the formation of a liquid plug or due to the collapse of a flexible tube as in \cite{Macklem} or a combination of both. Animal studies by Hughes \etal\cite{hughes1970site} have provided histological evidence that airway closure first appears in the very small airways during lung respiration. Kamm \& Schroter\cite{kamm1989airway} also showed that such phenomenon is quite common at the end of expiration for narrow airways with small diameters. If it does not happen at end of expiration with the surface tension decreasing to its minimum, it may occur during early in inspiration when the surface tension increases rapidly. The surface tension of pulmonary surfactant is smaller during surface contraction than expansion \cite{weibel1984pathway}, which results in lower lung volume during expiration than inspiration \cite{frazer1980effects}. Everett and Haynes \cite{everett1972model} and Mohanty \cite{mohanty1981fluids} examined the static stability of collars. They showed that if the thickness of the collars was sufficiently large, the system was unstable and was able to form a liquid bridge. Hickox \cite{hickox1971instability} looked into the linear stability for a circular pipe with Poiseuille base flow and a concentric interface, and considered the instability of long-wave perturbations with small Reynolds numbers. Daniel and Joseph \cite{joseph1984instability} studied the flow of two immiscible fluids of different viscosities and equal density through a pipe under a pressure gradient. %The effect of surfactant has been studied by a lot of researchers. Jensen \& Grotberg \cite{Jensen1992} investigated shock evolution and file rupture with surfactant along a thin viscous film. De Wit, Gallez \& Christov \cite{De1994} considered the dynamics of a free-liquid film with insoluble surfactants nonlinear evolution equations for the film thickness, the surfactants concentration and the tangential velocity of the fluid in the film. Rubinstein \& Bankoff \cite{Rubinstein2001} conducted weakly nonlinear analysis of thin liquid films with insoluble surfactants coated solid surface. Halpern \& Frenkel \cite{Halpern2003} studied creeping flow of a two-layer system with insoluble surfactant monolayer distributed along the interface. Surface tension driven flows are also important(\cite{davis1974motion}, \cite{espinosa1997thin}) as the surfactant concentration decreases till a monolayer. Experimental study about surfactant spreading on thin viscous films was conducted by Bull \& Grotberg \cite{bull2003surfactant}.
%%%%Frazer and Weber  \cite{frazer1976trapped} showed that the rate of inflation is the key component of the formation of liquid bridge but the rate of deflation.

Otis \etal\cite{Otis1993} and Halpern \& Grotberg\cite{Halpern1993} considered the effect of insoluble surfactant at the interface of a single layer coating a cylindrical rigid tube and a gas core, and showed that surfactant could be stabilizing. Pulmonary surfactants are surface-active molecules produced by type II alveolar cells that like to migrate to air-liquid interfaces (Weibel \cite{weibel1984pathway}), which is composed of phospholipids such as dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and protein (Hawgood \cite{hawgood1997surfactant}, Sch{\"u}rch \etal\cite{schurch1989captive}). Surfactants reduce the surface tension by interacting with the cohesive force between water molecules at an air-liquid interface. This reduction diminishes the effect of the capillary flow that drives the instability in the liquid layer. In addition, a non-uniform surfactant distribution generates a Marangoni shearing (force) along the interface, which normally opposes the capillary flow. The capillary flow is driven by surface tension due to a pressure difference, and the convection of surfactant along the interface produces a surface-tension gradient that induces a surface flow opposing the capillary flow. %Ghadiali \etal \cite{ghadiali2000investigation} investigated the physicochemical behavior of pulmonary surfactant under airway reopening conditions. Airway reopening mechanics depend on surfactant properties due to the stabilizing effect of surfactant. Bilek \etal \cite{bilek2003mechanisms} studied the mechanisms of surface-tension-induced epithelial cell damage by considering the effect of surfactant.

Later on, Kwak \& Pozrikidis \cite{Kwak2001} investigated the stability of two annular layers between two concentric cylinders.  They showed that insoluble surfactants reduce the growth rate of interfacial disturbances for a limited set of parameters. Campana \etal\cite{Campana2004} developed an accurate 2-D numerical model of the Rayleigh instability and made comparisons with Otis's \etal\cite{Otis1993} 1-D numerical model. Heil \etal\cite{heil2011fluid} considered the influence of surfactant and included fluid-structure interactions.

%%%%%%My work%%%%%%
In our work, we consider a liquid bilayer coating a compliant tube wall with an insoluble surfactant monolayer present along the \textit{mucus-gas} interface. This is described in chapter \ref{chap: Governing_Eqn_boundary_conditions_dim}, where we set up the governing equations for the fluid motion within the two layers, the transport of surfactant and the motion of the wall.

Inspired by Goren \cite{Goren1962}, an approach is introduced to investigate a less complicated case but accurate for all linear disturbances: a liquid bilayer contained within a rigid tube but with surfactant distributed along the \textit{mucus-gas} interface. Stream functions are introduced in each liquid layer, which satisfy the continuity equations automatically. We neglect inertia in this model, which results in a system of biharmonic differential equations (also known as Orr-Sommerfeld equations) for the stream functions. We perturb the interfaces and the surfactant concentration with small amplitude disturbances, and linearize the boundary conditions. By using a normal modes analysis, an eigenvalue problem is obtained. In order to get non-trivial solutions, the matrix in the eigenvalue problem must be singular. A third order polynomial for the growth rate of the perturbation is derived, whose coefficients are functions of many system parameters, and the wavenumber of the disturbances. The relevant system parameters for the rigid tube case are: the viscosity ratio of the two liquid layers, the thickness of the bilayer, the unperturbed surface tension ratio of the \textit{mucus-gas} interface and the \textit{serous-mucus} interface, the aspect ratio of the two layers, the surfactant strength measured by Marangoni number. The influence of these parameters on the stability of this system is investigated in chapter \ref{chap: arbitrary_thickness}. The advantage of this approach is that it is valid for any thickness of the liquid bilayer. A lubrication theory model is also carried for this rigid tube case. Comparisons are given in chapter \ref{chap: log_approach}. We did not include wall compliance effects in the arbitrary thickness model because the equations describing the wall motion would have been quite challenging.

The other approach that we use to study the stability of the bilayer in a tube is an extended lubrication theory model, which is elaborated in chapter \ref{chap: extended_lubrication}. The difference between the so called extended lubrication theory model and the more standard lubrication theory model is that, the former retains the radial dependency in the governing equations and boundary conditions without expressing $r$ in terms of a local coordinate which is then expanded in a Taylor series; while the latter one assumes thin liquid layer by assuming the rate of change in the radial direction is much larger than in the axial direction. In this case local coordinates are introduced and only leading order terms are kept. In chapter \ref{chap: extended_lubrication}, we apply the extended lubrication theory for the general case described in chapter \ref{chap: Governing_Eqn_boundary_conditions_dim} and obtain a system of coupled nonlinear evolution equations for the locations of the \textit{serous-mucus} interface, the \textit{mucus-gas} interface, the tube wall location, and the surfactant concentration. Later on, we linearize this system of nonlinear evolution equations in chapter \ref{chap: log_approach} and use it to investigate the linear stability of the general case. Again normal modes are applied and a linear system of four homogeneous equations is obtained for the amplitudes of the perturbations of interfaces, including the tube wall, \textit{serous-mucus}, and \textit{mucus-gas}, as well as the surfactant concentration. This system has non-trivial solutions, provided the matrix in this eigenvalue problem is singular. This gives a fourth order polynomial for the growth rate. Linear stability analysis is conducted to study the stabilizing and destabilizing effects of different parameters. Numerical results are provided in chapter \ref{chap: log_approach}.

The last part of this thesis investigates what happens to the disturbances beyond the linear regime by solving a system of nonlinear evolution equations derived in chapter \ref{chap: extended_lubrication}. We use the method of lines where we replace all the spatial derivatives with fourth order finite differences. A system of stiff ordinary differential equations are obtained, which is solved using a multi-step ODE solver. Small initial perturbations are provided as initial conditions, when the perturbations are small. The numerical results displayed in chapter \ref{chap: nonlinear_stab} are consistent with the linear stability analysis as shown in chapters \ref{chap: arbitrary_thickness} and \ref{chap: log_approach}.

The focus of the stability analysis in this thesis is to investigate the influence of wall characteristics, the parameters that reflect different physical properties of two liquid layers, and the insoluble surfactant along the gas-liquid interface.
