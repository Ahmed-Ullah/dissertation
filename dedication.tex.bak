This dissertation is lovingly dedicated to my mother, \textit{Wenxia Xiao}. Her encouragement, support, and constant love help me sustain throughout my life. My special gratitude goes to my two brothers, \textit{Delong} and \textit{Debiao}, who are reliable and supportive to me. Writing a dissertation means a lot to me, which is not only a piece of work but also a finishing chapter of my student life. I greatly appreciate my decision of pursuing a doctoral degree, especially in mathematics.
